# BuildVision — Budget & Expense System Audit

**Date:** 2026-06-05  
**Scope:** All budget, price-book, estimator, and financial code. Read-only audit — no production code changed.  
**Auditor:** Phase 11A task agent

---

## A. What Already Exists and Works

### Price Book — Schema

The `budget_categories` and `budget_items` tables serve a **dual-purpose model**:

| Column | Platform library | Company price book |
|---|---|---|
| `companyId` | `NULL` | `<uuid>` |
| Managed by | Super Admin (`/api/budget/*`) | Company Owner (`/api/company/price-book/*`) |

**`budget_categories`** (`shared/schema.ts` ~line 367)
- `id`, `name`, `notes`, `displayOrder` (int), `isActive` (bool), `companyId` (nullable FK → companies)

**`budget_items`** (`shared/schema.ts` ~line 380)
- `id`, `categoryId` (FK), `description`, `itemType`, `unitType`
- Price columns: `cost`, `laborRate`, `materialFee`, `retailPrice` (all `numeric`, nullable)
- Overhead columns: `burdens`, `subRate` (both `numeric`, nullable) — present in schema but see Section B
- `notes`, `displayOrder`, `isActive`, `companyId` (nullable FK)

### Price Book — API Routes (all correct)

**Admin/platform library** (`requireAdmin` middleware, `server/routes.ts` ~line 4999):
- `GET /api/budget/categories` — returns only `companyId=null` categories
- `GET /api/budget/categories/:id/items` — verifies category is platform-level before returning
- `GET /api/budget/items` — returns all platform items via `getAllBudgetItems()`
- `GET /api/budget/items/:id` — 404s if `item.companyId !== null`
- `POST /api/budget/items` — always saves with `companyId: null`; validates categoryId is platform-level
- `PATCH /api/budget/items/:id` — whitelists mutable fields; `companyId` is never mutated
- `DELETE /api/budget/items/:id` — guards against deleting company-owned items

**Company price book** (`requireCompanyOwner` middleware, `server/routes.ts` ~line 758 and 4801):

`requireCompanyOwner` allows: `company_owner` **OR** `isCompanyAdmin === true` **OR** `admin`. It is **not** owner-only. Any company admin can read/write the company price book, as can platform admins.

- `GET /api/company/price-book/categories` — scoped to `user.companyId`
- `POST /api/company/price-book/categories` — injects `companyId` from session
- `PATCH /api/company/price-book/categories/:id` — verifies `existing.companyId === user.companyId`; whitelists fields; `companyId` cannot change
- `DELETE /api/company/price-book/categories/:id` — same ownership check
- `GET /api/company/price-book/items` — scoped to `user.companyId`
- `POST /api/company/price-book/items` — verifies `category.companyId === user.companyId` before creating
- `PATCH /api/company/price-book/items/:id` — ownership check; if `categoryId` changes, also verifies new category ownership
- `DELETE /api/company/price-book/items/:id` — ownership check

**Conclusion:** All ownership guards on the price book are correct and fully company-isolated.

### Price Book — Bulk Import Flow

Two-step flow, both behind `requireCompanyOwner`:

1. `POST /api/company/price-book/parse-file` — accepts XLSX or CSV via `multer` memory storage (10 MB limit); uses `xlsx` library to return `{ rows, headers }` as JSON. No data is saved here.
2. `POST /api/company/price-book/bulk-import` — accepts `items[]` array; groups by `category` name; finds-or-creates categories; saves items with `companyId` injected from session. **Not transactional** — partial imports are possible if the server crashes mid-loop (minor risk).

**Client-side mapping UI** (`client/src/pages/company-dashboard.tsx`, price book section):
- Auto-detects column mappings by keyword matching (e.g. "labor" → laborRate)
- User can review/edit rows before submitting
- Accepts manual table entry or file upload
- Column mapping supports: category, description, unitType, laborRate, materialFee, retailPrice, itemType

### Floor Calculator Integration

- Route: `GET /api/calculator/items` (`requireContractorOrAdmin`) — returns **all** company price book items (`storage.getCompanyPriceBookItems(companyId)`); no floor-type filtering at the route level
- Route: `GET /api/calculator/categories` — returns **all** company price book categories (`storage.getCompanyPriceBookCategories(companyId)`); no filtering
- Route: `GET /api/calculator/categories/:id/items` — returns items for one category (`storage.getCompanyPriceBookItemsByCategory(id, companyId)`)
- Route: `GET /api/calculator/items/search` — accepts a `q` query param for text search (the only route that filters)
- Floor-type filtering is done **client-side** in `floor-calculator.tsx` (matching unitType for SF/SQ or description keywords)
- All routes are fully company-scoped via `user.companyId`

### Budget Admin Page

`client/src/pages/budget-admin.tsx` **exists** (previous audit notes flagged it as missing — this was incorrect).

- Route registered at `/company/budget` in `client/src/App.tsx`
- Accessible to both super admins (`isAdmin=true`) and company owners/admins (`isCompanyUser=true`)
- Dynamically switches API base: admins use `/api/budget`, company users use `/api/company/price-book`
- Shows "Labor Budget Categories" and "Floor Calculator Pricing" sections using category `notes` to distinguish ("Floor Calculator" in notes → floor section)
- Displays `burdens` and `subRate` fields in the edit dialog alongside cost/material/labor/retail

### Invoices — Core Tables

**`invoices`** (`shared/schema.ts` ~line 158):
- `id`, `customId`, `clientName`, `projectName`, `amount`, `dueDate`, `status`, `type`, `projectId` (nullable FK)

**`invoice_line_items`** (`shared/schema.ts` ~line 174):
- `id`, `invoiceId` (FK), `description`, `quantity`, `rate`, `amount`

**`recurringBilling`** (`shared/schema.ts` ~line 187):
- `id`, `customId`, `clientName`, `projectName`, `amount`, `frequency`, `nextRunDate`, `status`, `projectId` (nullable FK)

**Accounting Dashboard** (`client/src/pages/accounting-dashboard.tsx`):
- Displays invoices (outstanding, overdue, paid totals) and recurring billing items
- Computes totals client-side from the full invoices array
- Read-only reporting; no expense categories or project-budget comparison

### Estimates — Core Tables

**`estimates`** (`shared/schema.ts` ~line 128):
- `id`, `customId`, `clientName`, `projectName`, `amount`, `status`, `date`, `projectId` (nullable FK)

**`estimate_line_items`** (`shared/schema.ts` ~line 143):
- `id`, `estimateId` (FK), `category`, `item`, `quantity`, `unit`, `rate`, `total`

### Estimator UI (`client/src/pages/estimator.tsx`)

- Contractors select a project, then manually enter line items (no price-book lookup)
- Available categories (hardcoded dropdown): Labor, Materials, Equipment, Subcontractor, Permits, Overhead, Other
- Available units (hardcoded): EA, SF, LF, HR, LS, CY, SY, LB, GAL, TON
- Can load an existing estimate to copy its line items
- Generates `customId` in format `EST-YYYYMMDD-XXXX`
- Enforces `requireActiveSubscription` on `POST /api/estimates`

### Projects — Budget Fields

**`projects`** table (`shared/schema.ts` ~line 104):
- `budget` (`numeric`) — single total budget number
- `budgetStatus` (`text`) — free-text label (e.g. "On Track", "Over Budget")
- No breakdown by category, phase, or trade

---

## B. What Exists but Is Incomplete

### B1. Hardcoded Overhead and Profit in Estimator

**File:** `client/src/pages/estimator.tsx` lines ~157–159

```typescript
const overhead = subtotal * 0.1;    // hardcoded 10%
const profit   = subtotal * 0.15;   // hardcoded 15%
const grandTotal = subtotal + overhead + profit;
```

- These multipliers are **client-side constants** with no database backing and no per-company configuration
- Changing them requires a code deploy
- No UI to adjust or display the overhead/profit percentages to the user
- The computed `grandTotal` is what gets saved as `estimates.amount` — the breakdown (subtotal / overhead / profit) is never persisted

### B2. `burdens` and `subRate` Fields Are Unused in Estimates

**Schema:** `budget_items.burdens` and `budget_items.subRate` exist and are stored on price book items.

**Problem:** The estimator has no mechanism to read these values. Line items in `estimate_line_items` only store `category`, `item`, `quantity`, `unit`, `rate`, and `total`. There is no `laborBurden`, `subRate`, or overhead breakdown column on estimate line items. The fields are editable in the budget-admin UI but have zero downstream effect on any financial calculation.

### B3. No Price-Book-to-Estimate Linkage

- The estimator creates all line items via manual text entry only
- There is no "pick from price book" flow
- `estimate_line_items` has no `budgetItemId` FK or `priceBookItemId` reference
- No way to push a price-book rate change to existing estimates

### B4. No Project-Level Budget Breakdown

`projects.budget` is a single number. There is:
- No per-category budget allocation (e.g. "$20k labor, $15k materials")
- No per-phase budget tracking
- No `project_budgets` table or budget line item table
- No way to track planned vs. actual cost at a granular level

### B5. No Expense / Actual Cost Tracking

There is no `expenses` table, no `project_costs` table, and no "actual cost" concept anywhere in the schema or routes. The accounting dashboard shows invoice totals only (money going *out* to clients), not money spent by the contractor. The `budget vs actual` comparison that contractors typically need does not exist.

### B6. `estimates` and `invoices` Have No Direct `companyId` Column

Neither the `estimates` table nor the `invoices` table has a `companyId` column. The API enforces company scoping only through an **indirect ownership chain**:

```
estimates.projectId → projects.contractorId → users.companyId
```

This means:
- `GET /api/estimates` calls `storage.getEstimates(companyId)` — the storage layer must JOIN through projects to filter by company (verify in `server/storage.ts`)
- `GET /api/estimates/:id` does a 4-level ownership walk at the route level (see Section C below)
- If `projectId` is `null`, the `GET /api/estimates/:id` route returns 403 for non-admins — but a null projectId estimate can still be *created* if validation allows it

Same pattern applies to `invoices` and `recurringBilling`.

### B7. Floor Calculator Category Detection Uses `notes` Field — Fragile Heuristic

`budget-admin.tsx` uses `category.notes?.includes("Floor Calculator")` to classify floor calculator categories. This is a fragile text match with no enum or boolean column. If a note is edited accidentally, items disappear from or appear in the wrong section.

### B8. No Estimate Status Workflow Beyond `draft`

`estimates` has a `status` field (values used in the UI: `draft`, `sent`, `approved`, `rejected`). `estimate_line_items` has **no status field** — status exists only on the parent estimate record. Gaps:
- No timestamp columns on `estimates` (`sentAt`, `approvedAt`, `rejectedAt`)
- No notes/reason field for rejection
- No version history or revision tracking
- Client-side UI renders the status badge but there is no approval workflow page for clients

### B9. Bulk Import Is Not Transactional

`POST /api/company/price-book/bulk-import` loops through categories and items without wrapping the operation in a database transaction. A server crash or DB error mid-loop leaves a partial import with some categories created and some items missing. The endpoint should be wrapped in `db.transaction()`.

---

## C. Security / Scoping Risks

### C1. Estimates Scoped Indirectly Through 4-Level Ownership Chain

**File:** `server/routes.ts` ~line 2459 (`GET /api/estimates/:id`)

```
estimate → estimate.projectId → project → project.contractorId → contractor.companyId
```

If **any link in this chain is null** (orphan estimate, project without a contractorId, contractor with no companyId), the route returns `403 Access Denied` — which is safe but silent. The risk is a different kind of failure: valid data that happens to have a null intermediate FK becomes inaccessible rather than the data leaking.

A direct `estimates.companyId` FK would allow a single-query ownership check with no chain traversal and no null-gap risk.

### C2. `invoices` Has the Same Indirect-Scoping Pattern

`GET /api/invoices` calls `storage.getInvoices(companyId)`. The storage method must JOIN through `projects` to determine company membership for the same reason — no `invoices.companyId` column. If `invoice.projectId` is null, the invoice is either unreachable or returned for all companies (depending on the storage implementation — this warrants verification).

**Action required:** Audit `storage.getInvoices()` implementation to confirm null-`projectId` invoices are not returned to unrelated companies.

### C3. `recurringBilling` Scoping — Confirmed Correct

`GET /api/recurring-billing` (`server/routes.ts` ~line 2747) passes `user.companyId` to `storage.getRecurringBilling(companyId)` for non-admin callers. The storage method filters by company via project join, mirroring the pattern used for estimates and invoices. **No cross-company leak risk confirmed** for recurring billing.

### C4. Budget Admin Page Permission Model Matches the API

`budget-admin.tsx` grants UI access to `company_owner || isCompanyAdmin`. The underlying `requireCompanyOwner` API middleware (`server/routes.ts` line 764) uses the same rule: `company_owner OR isCompanyAdmin OR admin`. The UI and API are consistent — there are no phantom 403 errors for company admins. Note: this means any company admin (not just the owner) can create, edit, or delete price book items. Whether this is intentional access control policy should be confirmed with the business owner.

## D. Recommended Schema / Data-Model Changes

These are prerequisite schema additions for the Phase 11B build. No implementation order is implied — business decisions in Section F must be made first.

### D1. Add `companyId` directly to `estimates` and `invoices`

```sql
ALTER TABLE estimates     ADD COLUMN company_id VARCHAR REFERENCES companies(id);
ALTER TABLE invoices      ADD COLUMN company_id VARCHAR REFERENCES companies(id);
ALTER TABLE recurring_billing ADD COLUMN company_id VARCHAR REFERENCES companies(id);
```

Backfill via the existing project → contractor → company chain. Add a DB-level index on `company_id` for query performance.

### D2. Add `project_budgets` Table — Project-Level Budget Breakdown

```
project_budgets
  id, projectId (FK), companyId (FK),
  category (text — Labor/Materials/Equipment/etc.),
  plannedAmount (numeric),
  actualAmount (numeric),   -- updated as expenses are logged
  notes (text),
  createdAt, updatedAt
```

Links to project's overall `budget` field but allows per-category tracking.

### D3. Add `expenses` Table — Actual Cost Tracking

```
expenses
  id, projectId (FK), companyId (FK),
  category (text),
  description (text),
  amount (numeric),
  date (text),
  vendorName (text, nullable),
  receiptUrl (text, nullable),
  createdByUserId (FK),
  createdAt
```

This enables "budget vs actual" reporting.

### D4. Add `priceBookItemId` FK to `estimate_line_items`

```sql
ALTER TABLE estimate_line_items ADD COLUMN price_book_item_id VARCHAR REFERENCES budget_items(id);
```

Nullable — manual entries leave it null; price-book-sourced items set it. Enables "update rate from price book" workflow.

### D5. Add `overhead_profiles` Table — Per-Company Configurable Overhead

```
overhead_profiles
  id, companyId (FK),
  name (text),               -- e.g. "Standard", "Residential"
  overheadPercent (numeric), -- replaces hardcoded 10%
  profitPercent (numeric),   -- replaces hardcoded 15%
  taxPercent (numeric, nullable),
  isDefault (boolean),
  createdAt
```

Eliminates the hardcoded multipliers in `estimator.tsx`.

### D6. Add `isFloorCalculator` Boolean to `budget_categories`

```sql
ALTER TABLE budget_categories ADD COLUMN is_floor_calculator BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
```

Replaces the fragile `notes.includes("Floor Calculator")` heuristic in `budget-admin.tsx`.

### D7. Add Timestamps to `estimates` for Status Workflow

```sql
ALTER TABLE estimates
  ADD COLUMN sent_at      TIMESTAMPTZ,
  ADD COLUMN approved_at  TIMESTAMPTZ,
  ADD COLUMN rejected_at  TIMESTAMPTZ,
  ADD COLUMN rejection_reason TEXT;
```

## E. Recommended Next Build Phase (Phase 11B — Prioritised)

Listed in recommended implementation order:

1. **Add `companyId` to `estimates`, `invoices`, `recurringBilling`** (D1)  
   Prerequisite for everything else. Schema migration, backfill, update storage queries. Low risk, high security value.

2. **Add `overhead_profiles` table and wire to estimator** (D5)  
   Removes hardcoded constants. Company owners configure their default overhead/profit %; estimator reads it. UI: settings tab on company dashboard.

3. **Add "pick from price book" flow to estimator** (D4)  
   Allow contractors to search/select a price book item to pre-fill a line item's description, unit, and rate. Adds `priceBookItemId` FK. Dramatically speeds up estimate creation.

4. **Add `project_budgets` breakdown table** (D2)  
   Replace single `projects.budget` number with per-category allocations. Show "Budget Allocation" card on project details page.

5. **Add `expenses` table and Expense Logging UI** (D3)  
   Minimal: date, amount, category, description. Medium: receipt image upload. Enable "Budget vs Actual" card on project details.

6. **Fix bulk import to use a DB transaction** (B9)  
   Small code change — wrap the loop in `db.transaction()` in `server/routes.ts` ~line 4919.

7. **Add `isFloorCalculator` boolean to `budget_categories`** (D6)  
   Small schema change. Update `budget-admin.tsx` UI and `/api/calculator/*` queries to use the boolean.

8. **Audit and fix `recurringBilling` scoping** (C3)  
   Confirm or fix that recurring billing records cannot be read cross-company.

## F. Items That Need Business/Formula Decisions Before Coding

The following require answers from the business owner before any implementation begins:

### F1. Overhead and Profit Formula

- Is the current **10% overhead + 15% profit** formula correct for all job types, or should it vary?
- Should overhead and profit be configurable **per company**, **per estimate**, or both?
- Should overhead apply to **all categories** (Labor, Materials, Subs, etc.) or only to Labor?
- Is there a separate **tax** percentage to apply, and at what level?

### F2. `burdens` Field — What Does It Represent?

The `budget_items.burdens` column exists in schema but is never used in calculations. Clarify:
- Does "burdens" mean payroll tax burden (e.g. FICA, workers comp) as a **percentage** or a **flat dollar amount**?
- Is it a fixed cost added to labor rate, or a multiplier applied to labor subtotal?
- Should it roll up into the estimate total automatically, or is it internal cost-tracking only?

### F3. `subRate` Field — What Does It Represent?

Similarly undefined. Clarify:
- Is `subRate` the rate paid *to* a subcontractor for a given line item?
- Is it separate from `laborRate` (company's own crew) or does one replace the other depending on who does the work?
- Should the estimator show both rates and let the user choose?

### F4. "Near Me 1%" — What Is This?

Referenced in earlier product discussions. Clarify:
- Is this a 1% fee charged on estimate total, invoice total, or something else?
- Is it a platform fee or a contractor markup?
- Which route/calculation should apply it?

### F5. Budget vs. Actual — What Triggers `actualAmount` Updates?

Once an `expenses` table exists, clarify the business rules:
- Does logging an expense automatically update `project_budgets.actualAmount` for the matching category?
- Does approving a change order automatically add its cost to the project budget?
- Does marking an invoice as "paid" count as actual cost, or are invoices and expenses separate tracks?

### F6. Estimate Approval Workflow — Client-Facing or Internal?

- Should clients be able to approve/reject estimates from the client portal?
- If yes, does approval require e-signature (like change orders), or is a button click sufficient?
- Should approved estimates automatically convert to invoices?
